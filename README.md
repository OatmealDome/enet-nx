This is a partial port of ENet to NintendoSDK, tested specifically with the Nintendo Switch.

Connecting to a host and communicating it works. However, any functionality that has to do with creating a server is not implemented.

While this was developed for use with [Starlight](https://github.com/shadowninja108/Starlight/) and reverse engineered headers, it will likely work fine with the official SDK if you have access to it (though you might have to fix the includes and some constant names).
